Step 1: Configuration variables
git config --global user.name "Gabriel Regus"
git config --global user.email "gabriel.regus@gmail.com"

Step 2: Initialize Git
git init
(you could see the files by typing ls-la)
Step 3: Staging Files
git add filename
#git add --all
#git add -A
#git add .

Step 4: Committing changes to staging area
git commit -m "First Commit"

Step 5: Git log

Three places to work enviroments:
Working: 
Staging (add command): dating before marriage
Commit: 

Tracked files 
Unmodified -  the file hasn't changed since the last commit
Modified - the file has changed since the last commit
Stage - files moved into the staging 

git restore - will restore the changes

6. Create a copy of a branch
git switch -c 'name of new branch'
merge the changes from one branch to another branch

7. Delete branch (it's good practice to delete the branch once you've finished with it)

Gitflow
a. Feature/fix branch
b. Make changes
c. Merge to master
d. Delete old branch


pushing from your local machine to github
# git push  --upstream-to origin main
git push -u origin main # --set-upstream
# git push --all
# git branch --set-upstream-to <origin/remote-branch>

##Syncing github with local hard drive

Clone
(Gitlab) git clone git@git.bootcampcontent.com:Columbia-University/CU-VIRT-FSF-PT-03-2023-U-LOLC.git

Fetch - take from the repo and sync to your local drive

Pull is a combination 

#Search for branches
git branch
git branch -a

git pull

cd <folder-name> command and run git pull origin main.
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master main

to remove a git repo use this code

For Git to know where we want files to go when we do a git push of items in our local repository, we need to add a reference to that respository. Enter the following command in the console window

git remote add origin git@github.com:ColumbiaCoding/03-JavaScript.git
